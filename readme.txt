== Frequently Asked Quesions ==

The theme provides a new section, called "Default Featured 
Images", located in the customizer, just below "Colors".

This new section provided some new controls, including some 
images from us in case you don't have any good images right 
now.

changed.

As a bonus, we have 4 pre-built color palettes for you.
